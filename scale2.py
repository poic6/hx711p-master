# I've found out that, for some reason, the order of the bytes is not always the same between versions of python, numpy and the hx711 itself.
# Still need to figure out why does it change.
# If you're experiencing super random values, change these values to MSB or LSB until to get more stable values.
# There is some code below to debug and log the order of the bits and the bytes.
# The first parameter is the order in which the bytes are used to build the "long" value.
# The second paramter is the order of the bits inside each byte.
# According to the HX711 Datasheet, the second parameter is MSB so you shouldn't need to modify it.

# HOW TO CALCULATE THE REFFERENCE UNIT
# To set the reference unit to 1. Put 1kg on your sensor or anything you have and know exactly how much it weights.
# In this case, 92 is 1 gram because, with 1 as a reference unit I got numbers near 0 without any weight
# and I got numbers around 184000 when I added 2kg. So, according to the rule of thirds:
# If 2000 grams is 184000 then 1000 grams is 184000 / 2000 = 92.
